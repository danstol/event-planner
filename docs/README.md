to business with expensive plans and very special set of features, There are no
simple event planners that allow for quick and easy brain dump for event planning.

How

The philosophy is simple: keep track of everything that an event needs in one
place. So far the plan includes

- People: who is invited, main way to identify someone is with an email and you
  can send invitations, updates and split costs with anyone that is part of an
  event

- Places: various places where the event can take place, it can be a community
  hall, bar, someones basement or a combination thereof. Will include Google map
  links and phone numbers and for Premium members potentially an ability to call
  the venue right from the planner with Twilio

- Payments: event costs, can be as detailed or as broad as you wish. Will also
  have an ability to split costs with other people if you so choose

- Schedule: event schedule, a perfect event is a planned event. A calendar style
  page that will let you plan in blocks how your event will play out

- To-Do checklist: dont forget to do important things so that your event goes
  without a hitch

- Reports/Overview: quick glance at the event information, a summary of all of
  the above
